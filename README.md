# TASK-3
SQL 1.sql:
It covers basic SQL SELECT statements, including selecting all columns, performing calculations, and using DISTINCT to find unique values.

SQL 2.sql:
Focuses on filtering data using WHERE clauses with various conditions (=, >=, !=, AND, OR, LIKE), grouping data with GROUP BY, ordering results with ORDER BY, limiting results with LIMIT, and using HAVING to filter groups.

SQL 5.sql:
Demonstrates string manipulation functions in SQL, such as LENGTH(), UPPER(), LOWER(), TRIM(), LEFT(), RIGHT(), SUBSTRING(), REPLACE(), CONCAT(), and LOCATE().

SQL 6.sql:
Uses the CASE statement for conditional logic within SQL queries, allowing for different outputs based on specified conditions (e.g., categorizing employees by age or adjusting salary based on certain criteria).

SQL 7.sql:
Illustrates the use of subqueries, specifically with the IN operator to filter records based on the results of another query, and also shows a basic subquery within the SELECT statement.

SQL 8.sql:
Explores subqueries and window functions. It shows how to nest queries and use functions like AVG(), SUM(), ROW_NUMBER(), RANK(), and DENSE_RANK() over partitions of data.

SQL 9.sql:
Introduces Common Table Expressions (CTEs) using the WITH clause to define temporary result sets that can be referenced within a SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE statement. It demonstrates using CTEs for complex queries involving joins and aggregations.

SQL 10.sql:
Covers temporary tables, showing how to create them using CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE, insert data, and select from them. Temporary tables are useful for storing intermediate results during a session.

SQL 11.sql:
Focuses on stored procedures, which are precompiled SQL code that can be executed with a single call. It demonstrates creating procedures with CREATE PROCEDURE, including those with parameters, and executing them with CALL.
SQL 12.sql:
Explores triggers and events. Triggers are actions that automatically occur in response to certain events (like INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE) on a table. Events are tasks that are scheduled to run at specific times.
